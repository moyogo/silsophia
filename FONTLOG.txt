SIL Sophia Font Sources
========================


This file provides detailed information on the SIL Sophia font files.
This information should be distributed along with the SIL Sophia fonts and
any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

These fonts provide outline sources for all the glyphs in the complete SIL Sophia family in a universally readable format (PostScript Type 1), and under an open license (SIL Open Font License version 1.1). They are not intended to be installable fonts, and likely will not work correctly with some systems. But they provide full and complete outlines for these older fonts, some of which are not included in newer font packages.

Although we do not plan any major revisions to this package, we may (or may not) fix major problems, and so we will remain as maintainers of this package.


ChangeLog
